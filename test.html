<h1> About me and why I chose this class. </h1>
    <p> My name is Kirkor Tanossian, I am 18 years old. I am majoring in Computer Science. I chose this class because I have used computers and apps pretty much all my life but I had no idea how they actually worked. I found out about programming just a couple months ago and thought it would be really cool to learn how to code. </p>
